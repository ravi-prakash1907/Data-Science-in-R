## R-Studio with GitHub

This week focuses onto the concept of the Git.<br />
We have discussed about the difference between Git & Github and went through the concepts of _Gists_ and _Repositories_.<br /><br />

Here we have discussed about the **GitHub** and tells the significance of the **version control**. Also we are directed that how can we set a a GitHub repository anf link it with R-Studio<br />

### Terms
1. GitHub
2. A git Repository
3. Version controle
    - it enables to revert back to any previous version of the project fron any later version.<br />
    In this way, there is no fear to end up with a non working function

A GitHub repository is mainly useful in proper docuentation, storing and sharing any project work, in a better way.
