This is the very first intro to the data science and the most frequent tools used by a data science.

Here few of the most importent things are discussed, like:<br />
> * What is the Data Science? (by different point of views)
> * What is Big Data?
> * Who's a Data Scientist?

### Data Science
It involves:
1. Statistics, computer science, mathematics
2. Data cleaning and formatting
3. Data visualization

### Big Data
It has the following qualities:
1. Volume
    - The continuously growing data (in terms of large size)
2. Velocity
    - Data is being generated far more frequently
3. Variety
    - The data that's to be analysed has various forms

### Skills of a Data Scientists
* Hacking Skills
* Mathametical & Statistical Knowledge
* Sunbstantive Expert

_"Data is a **set** of **quantitative or qualitative** variables"_
> * **Set:** In stats, the population we wish to analyse about
> * **Variable:** Measurement or Charectorstics
> * **Quantitative:** Related to quantities e.g. Pressure
