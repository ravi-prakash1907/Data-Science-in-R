## Starting to Code in R

From this week, the actual coding poration starts. In order to go through the whole basic knowledge and prereqisites of R, in this week, we are taught to do some basic but important thongs in R.

### Concepts:

> Control Statements
> * Conditional
>     - _if-else_ ```if(){} else{}```
> * Loops
>     - _for loop_ ```for(i in 1:10)```
>     - _while loop_ ```while()```
> * ```repeat```, ```next``` & ```break```
> Function ```funName <- function(<params>)```<br />
> Scoping rules and coding standered<br />
> Working with **Date** & **Time**

For better prectice, we can install the ```swirl``` package for this course (JHU) and can work on it.<br />
