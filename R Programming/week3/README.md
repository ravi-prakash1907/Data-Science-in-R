## Next step in Looping

In this week, the _looping functions_ are introduced.<br />
Basically, it elaborates the ```apply()``` even further.

### Significance of ```apply()```

apply() function is very helpful to loop trough the range of things, repetedly and dynamically.<br />
Generally, it's pretty difficult to run a for loop on every sngle column of any R object like _dat frame_ or _table_.<br />
So, in order to achieve this easily, apply function is used.

### Varients of ```apply()```
> ```lapply()``` -> apply on **List**<br />
> ```mapply()``` -> apply on **Matrix**<br />
> ```tapply()``` -> apply on **Tables**<br />
> ```vapply()``` & ```sapply()``` -> apply on **Vectors**

**vapply()** is considered safer than **sapply()** because:
* Slight speed improvement
* Improves consistency by providing limited return type checks

For better prectice, we can install the ```swirl``` package for this course (JHU) and can practice following:
> lapply & sapply
> vapply & tapply
