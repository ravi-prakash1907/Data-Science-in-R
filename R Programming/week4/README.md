## Simulation & Profiling

In the last week, we learn the _Simulation_ & _Profiling_.<br />
We also learn the things like generating **random numbers** using functions like:
> ```dnorm()```<br />
> ```pnorm()```<br />
> ```qnorm()```<br />
> ```rnorm()```

We also come to know how to arrange/order the things in output etc..<br />

### Profiler
They are very handy tools.<br />
These are helpful in understanding the time spent by **R**. It provides a _interactive graphical interface_ for visualizing data from **Rprof** , R's built-in tool for collecting profiling data and, profvis , a tool for visualizing profiles from R.<br />
The profiler is composed by two main tabs:
1. Flame graph
2. Data

<hr />

### Aim
By the end of this week one becomes able to:
* Call the str function on an arbitrary R object
* Describe the difference between the **"by.self"** and **"by.total"** output produced by the R profiler
* Simulate a random normal variable with an arbitrary mean and standard deviation
* Simulate data from a normal linear model

<br />

For better prectice, we can install the ```swirl``` package for this course (JHU) and can practice following:
> Looking at Data<br />
> Simulation<br />
> Base Graphics
