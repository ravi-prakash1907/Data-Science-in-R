## Begining with R

In this very first week of this course, we begin with the all basics abour **R** and **R-Sudio**, including the installation guidance for R language, on _various operating systems_ and setting up the working directory in R-Studio.<br /><br />

### Intro
This poration basically covers:
1. 'How old the R language is?' i.e. _history_ of the language
2. Getting help while coding
3. Datatypes and basic operations.

```?<funName>``` is a frequently used method to get the help regr. any specific function of any installed (and loaded) _package_.

### History
It's about the R statistical programing environment. Basically R is a dialect of **S**. <br />
**S** was a language, or is a language that was developed by **John Chambers** and
at the now-defunct _Bell Labs_. Tt was initiated in ```1976``` as an _internal statistical analysis environment_, as an environment that people at Bell Labs could _use to analyze data_.<br /><br />
Robert Gentleman. 
After many revisions, R arsian. Basically, in ```1991```, it was created in **New Zealand** by two gentleman named **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman**.<br />
Now, but there's much more than this obviously, and on the, on CRAN, there are, right now there are about __*4,000 packages*__ that have been developed by users and programmers all around the world.<br />

### Datatypes
> * Vectors & Lists
> * Matrices
> * Factors
> * Lists
> * Data Frames & Tables

Here, we are also taught regr. _how tos_ of:
> * Dealing with missing values
> * Name attributes (for rows and columns)
> * Reading _large_ tables
> * Textual Data Formtas
> * Summary and Subbsetting
> * Vectorized operations etc..

Few importants are:<br />
```?<funName>```<br />
```c()```<br />
```<dataTypeName>()```<br />
```as.<dataType>()```<br />
```class()```<br />
```summary()```<br />
```dim()```<br />
