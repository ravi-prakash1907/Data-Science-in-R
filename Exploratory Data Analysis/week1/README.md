## Graphs & Plotting System

In this very first week of the course the entire focus is on understanding the **graphs** & **plotting models** for them for any available data. It also aims to covey the information about the significance of the different types of the graphs and visualizations. <br />

This week is very helpful for beginers to decide whether which type of the visualization is best for their (different format of) data.

### Plotting Systems in R
1. **Base :**
> * it's kinda _"arstist's canves"_ i.e. keep appending code for every single manipulation <br />
> * nothing is served by default <br />
> * everything has to be specified by the programmer
2. **Lattice :**
> * the entire plot is drawn using _single_ function call (e.g ```line()```) <br />
> * it consists of the various default settings,too <br />
> * can be a little _messy_ as user has to do all the formatting etc. in single function call <br />
3. **ggplot2 :**
> * hybrid of ```Base``` and ```Lattice``` <br />
> * has _dedicated function_ for various plots that _overcomes the overhead of various calculations etc.._ as that is in _Base plotting system_ <br />
> * _keep appending new lines of codes_ to implements more things _as in Base ploting system_ <br />
> * _dedicated functions_ for plots resemble the _concept of Lattice_  


### Base Plotting

1. ```graphics``` contains the _base_ plotting functions e.g. ```plot```, ```hist``` & ```boxplot``` <br />
