## Reading Data

In this week we only discuss how to read the data from various sources including **SQL server** & **APIs**.

### Main Sources
Following are the few main sources that are discussed in this 2<sup>nd</sup> week:
1. SQL
2. HDF5
3. Web
4. APIs

### Reading from SQL
This part gives a brief yet satisfactory amount of information regr. reading the data from a MySQL _(or any similar SQL server)_ from scratch. The package used is ```RMySql``` to connect to the _MySQL_ server<br />
Key concepts taught:
> **Connecting** to a SQL Server<br />
> Listing the **databases**<br />
> Listing he **tables** * their **dimentions**<br />
> _Reading the **data**_ from any perticular table<br />
> **Subsetting** the tables<br />
> Executing any desired SQL Query

Few most important functions are: ```dbConnect()```, ```dbGetQuery()```, ```dbSendQuery()```, ```dbReadTable()```, ```dbClearResult()```& ```dbDisconnect()```.

### Reading from HDF5
**HDF5** stores:<br />
> Large Datasets<br />
> Structured Datasets<br />
> **H**ierarchical **D**ata **F**ormat - 5 _(HDF5)_
