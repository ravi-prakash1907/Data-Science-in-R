## Understanding Data

In this week, we get to know about the **raw** and **processed** data. Further, we also get familier with method to read the _data of different formats_. We aim to collect the raw data so that it can be processed and converted into the **tidy data**.

### Raw vs Procesed Data
**1. Raw Data:**
> From original source of the data<br />
> Often **hard** to use for data analyses<br />
> Data analysis includes processing<br />
> Raw data might **ONLY** need processing

**1. Processed Data:**
> Such a data is **ready for analysis**<br />
> Processing can include **merging**, **subsetting**, **transforming**<br />
> Standereds for processing are possible<br />
> All the steps should be recorded


<br />

For a _tidy data_, we need to have a **metadeta** to describe it's columns. The _metadata_ is generally a simple _text file_.

### Data Collection
1. Downloading: using ```download.file(url, destfile, method)```
2. Reading: using ```read.table()```, ```read.csv()```, ```read.csv2()``` for CSV
3. For looking how to read other files like Excel, XML & JSON, visit to the codes of this week (link below)

**XPath** is one of the most important language that can prove to be very helpful while **reading XML files**.For understanding it better, have a look at [XML.pdf](XML.pdf)<br />

It's helpful in web scrapling.
